Movie Data Viewer using Letterboxd export data.

You can download your Letterboxd data from https://letterboxd.com/settings/data/
Once you've downloaded the zip folder, extract watched.csv and save to anywhere on your computer. Now that you have the .CSV, you will still need to clean the data. This is because I am bad at coding. I apologise. To clean the data, open the .CSV in Google Sheets or Excel. Delete the first line which includes the column names ('Date, Name, Year, Letterboxd URL'). Then using find and replace, remove every comma "," and replace with nothing "".Save the file. You can now use this application without it breaking in a weird way, hopefully.
